As a user I want to diversify my music taste and have an active understanding of the artists history, and their writing as well. This app will link the artist, their biography, and their lyrics all together, along with their spotify page. 
Through this lense of reading the artists lyrics and biography, it allows me, as a fan of the musicians to have a deeper experience of the music and see more clearly where the artist is coming from and how they've used their past experiences to create their art and the impact its had on their fans. 
Once linked back to their spotify page, I can see other artists that are associated with my favorite artists, or I can see what other people with similar music tastes are interested in.
